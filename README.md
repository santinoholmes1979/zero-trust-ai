# Zero Trust AI Behavioral Analytics

An end-to-end **Zero Trust behavioral analytics pipeline** that models user activity, establishes UEBA baselines, and detects high-risk anomalies using machine learning.

The system applies **Isolation Forest anomaly detection** to identify suspicious behavioral deviations and supports **SOC investigation workflows and case management**.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of **Zero Trust architecture, UEBA analytics, and AI-assisted cyber threat detection** within a simulated enterprise security environment.

This architecture simulates a behavioral security analytics pipeline used in modern Zero Trust environments. Security telemetry from multiple sources is normalized and used to build per-user behavioral baselines. Machine learning and rule-based analytics identify anomalies, assign risk scores, and generate alerts that analysts can investigate through an interactive SOC dashboard.

Pipeline layers:



Telemetry generation



Feature engineering \& behavioral baselines



Anomaly detection



Analyst investigation experience



🧠 Why This Matters



Traditional threshold alerts generate high false positives.

This system instead:



models normal behavior per user



detects statistical deviations



provides analyst context and workflow support



This aligns with modern:



Zero Trust principles



UEBA platforms



SOC automation trends



📊 Detection Approach

Behavioral Baselines



For each user, the pipeline computes:



mean



standard deviation



z-score deviations



Example features:



z\_failures



z\_mfa\_denied



z\_noncompliant



z\_high\_sev



z\_max\_speed\_kmh



This reduces false positives versus static thresholds.



Machine Learning Model



Model: Isolation Forest



Used for:



unsupervised anomaly detection



multi-feature behavioral analysis



risk scoring



Output fields:



anomaly\_score



anomaly\_flag



rule\_suspicious



Security Analytics Implemented
